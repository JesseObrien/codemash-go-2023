Some introductory things you Might Not Know about Go.

## Why Do We Use Go?

- Single deployable binaries!
- It has quite a large standard library. Compression, cyptography, sql database driver, embedding, encoding (JSON/XML), flags, html templates, http server/client, image manipulation, logging, mail, SMTP, regexp, system calls, time/date and more!
- Simple syntax and `gofmt` to enforce it.
- Runtime speed, build speed, testing speed, fuzzing and coverage tooling out of the box.
- Brilliant network stack capabilities in the stdlib.
- Pointers if we need them.
- ðŸ«¶ Emoji and unicode support right out of the box!

### Resources

- It has a playground! https://go.dev/play/ Use it to play around with an idea, or need to copy some code for someone to help you out.
- The Gophers slack is a great place to hang out, interact, find podcasts, resources and more! https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/
- Effective Go, part of the official documentation is actually a great book! https://go.dev/doc/effective_go
